# Automatic-Dreams

Our code will be able to transport the disabled person to its destination with no harm done. We will be implementing controls that will lift the person up and set them down safely. The sensors will be able to detect colors on the ground and any obstacles that are in the way. 

# Materials

* MatLab 
* EV3 bot 
* laptop 

# Process

* The EV3 will be connected to the laptop via bluetooth 
* All appropriate software is installed, Matlab, EV3 Toolbox 

# Controls


W: Move forward
S: Move backward
A: Turn left
D: Turn right

Up Arrow: Lift the forklift up
Down Arrow: Lower the forklift
Q: Stop the program and disconnect the EV3
No key pressed (case 0): Stop the wheels

# Color Sensor

There are sensors on the robot that will detect what color is on the ground, and display the corresponding color in the output. The code will also read what color was detected.
